# Final Report

### Game Description

User controls a sprite in  person perspective using a PS/2 keyboard to dodge the obstacles. There will be multiple lanes with obstacles or power-ups (like a shield) spawning randomly. A point system will be displayed on the screen. The sprite will "run" faster as time goes on (so it will be harder to dodge obstacles) and when the user hits an obstacle it will be game over, an audio clip will be played, and the final score will be displayed.
